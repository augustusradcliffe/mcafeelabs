Why Activation and Download Matters
-----------------------------------

Downloading and activating your McAfee product correctly is crucial. Without proper activation, you may not get the full protection suite, updates, or support. McAfee ties your product key or subscription to your account, ensuring you always stay protected on your registered devices. Activation also ensures that your software license is verified, preventing errors or interruptions later.

--------------------------------------

Before you start the process, make sure you have your McAfee product key ready. This key is usually:

- Sent to your registered email after an online purchase.  
- Printed on the retail card if purchased in-store.  
- Available in your McAfee account if you bought digitally.  

Keep this 25-digit product key safe, as it is essential for the activation process.
